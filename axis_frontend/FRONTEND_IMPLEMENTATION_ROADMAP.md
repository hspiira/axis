## Notes & Issues

### Phase 1 Implementation Notes

**Completed**: 2025-01-23

**Key Achievements**:
1. **Routing System**: Implemented comprehensive routing with protected routes, AppLayout component, and 6 pages (Dashboard, Cases, Clients, Contracts, Profile, NotFound)
2. **Axios Interceptors**: Created robust token refresh mechanism with request queuing and separate auth client to prevent interceptor loops
3. **Error Boundaries**: Implemented error boundary with dev/prod modes and placeholder for error tracking service integration
4. **Client Context**: Built complete multi-tenancy system with ClientSelector UI component, CUID validation, and cross-tab sync

**Performance**: Phase 1 completed in ~5 hours instead of estimated 5-7 days due to:
- Focused, uninterrupted implementation session
- Clear requirements from code review
- Leveraging existing TypeScript types and SOLID architecture
- No unexpected blockers

CONTRACTS - Business Logic Analysis

  Current Model Shows:
  - Contract relationship: Client ← Contract (one client, one
  contract)
  - No Service Provider relationship in the model
  - Focus: Client service agreements and billing

  You're RIGHT to question this! Here are the scenarios:

  Scenario 1: Client Contracts Tab (RECOMMENDED ✅)

  Implementation: Add a "Contracts" tab to the Client detail page

  Why this makes sense:
  - Contracts belong to clients (1-to-many: one client, multiple
  contracts)
  - Users navigate: "View Client → See their contracts"
  - Natural workflow: "Managing Client ABC → View their active
  contracts"
  - All contract actions happen in client context

  User Stories:
  - "As an admin, when viewing a client, I want to see all their
  contracts"
  - "As a finance manager, I want to renew a client's expiring
  contract"
  - "As a CSM, I want to see if a client's contract is active before
  onboarding"

  Scenario 2: Standalone Contracts Page (Current approach ⚠️)

  When it makes sense:
  - Finance team needs cross-client contract overview
  - Billing operations across all clients
  - Contract expiration monitoring (all clients)
  - Reporting: "Show me all contracts expiring this month"

  User Stories:
  - "As a finance manager, show me all overdue payments across
  clients"
  - "As an admin, show me all contracts expiring in 30 days"
  - "As a billing specialist, show me all pending renewals"

  RECOMMENDATION:

  Implement BOTH with different purposes:

  1. Client Detail → Contracts Tab (Primary interface)
    - CRUD operations for that specific client's contracts
    - Quick view of active/expired contracts
    - Renewal and payment actions
  2. Standalone Contracts Page (Management/Reporting)
    - Filterable list across ALL clients
    - Bulk operations (mark paid, send renewals)
    - Financial reporting views
    - Alert dashboard (overdue, expiring soon)

  ---
  DOCUMENTS - Business Logic Analysis

  Current Model Shows:
  client = ForeignKey('clients.Client')      # Optional
  contract = ForeignKey('contracts.Contract') # Optional

  Documents can be attached to:
  - Clients (company documents, registration, policies)
  - Contracts (signed agreements, amendments, invoices)
  - Or standalone (company-wide policies, templates)

  Scenario 1: Embedded Documents (RECOMMENDED ✅)

  Client Documents Tab:
  - Company registration
  - Business licenses
  - Company policies
  - Client-specific forms

  Contract Documents Tab:
  - Signed contract PDF
  - Amendments
  - Invoices
  - Payment receipts

  Scenario 2: Standalone Documents Page

  When it makes sense:
  - Document library/repository
  - Company-wide templates
  - Policy documents (not client-specific)
  - Search across all documents
  - Version management across the system

  User Stories:
  - "As HR, I need to find the latest employee handbook template"
  - "As compliance, I want to see all confidential documents across
  clients"
  - "As admin, I need to find a specific contract document quickly"

  RECOMMENDATION:

  Implement BOTH with different purposes:

  1. Embedded Documents (Primary)
    - Client detail → Documents tab (client-specific docs)
    - Contract detail → Documents tab (contract attachments)
  2. Standalone Documents Page (Library/Search)
    - Global document search
    - Template library
    - Company-wide policies
    - Document expiration monitoring
    - Confidential document access control
